Early diagnosis of the cancer cells is necessary for making an effective treatment plan and the health safety of a patient. Nowadays, doctors usually use a histological grade that pathologists determine by performing a semi-quantitative analysis of the histopathological and cytological features of hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stained histopathological images. This research contributes a potential classification model for cancer prognosis to efficiently utilize the valuable information underlying the HE-stained histopathological images. This work uses the PatchCamelyon benchmark datasets and trains them in a multi- layer perceptron and convolution model to observe the modelâ€™s performance in terms of precision, Recall, F1 Score, Accuracy, and AUC Score. The evaluation result shows that the baseline convolution model outperforms the baseline MLP model. Also, this paper introduced ResNet50 and InceptionNet models with data augmentation where ResNet50 able to beat the state-of- the-art model. Furthermore, majority vote and concatenation ensemble were evaluated and provides the future direction of using transfer learning, and segmentation to understand the specific features.
