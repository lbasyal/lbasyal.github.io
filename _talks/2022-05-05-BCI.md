The field of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology is rapidly advancing, with researchers working towards establishing a direct communication channel between the human brain and computers or external devices. This collaborative effort aims to facilitate communication by exchanging information derived from neural activities in the brain with the computer. A Brain-Computer Interface involves the seamless integration of the brain with mechanical devices, where the brain naturally accepts and controls these devices as an intrinsic part of its body representation. This innovative technology extracts electrophysiology signals from specific brain components and processes them to generate control signals for computers, robotic machines, or communication devices. The evolving landscape of BCI holds promise for revolutionizing the way humans interact with technology, opening up new avenues for enhanced communication and control in various applications.
