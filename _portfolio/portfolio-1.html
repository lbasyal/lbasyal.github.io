title: "Wine Recommendation System"
excerpt: "Recommendation systems are critical for selecting the right wine for customers, and this paper presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of wine reviews datasets to gain deeper insights. In addition, this paper demonstrates the use of a multi-label classification model, leveraging a BERT pre-trained model to classify different wine varieties. BERT is a bidirectional multilingual transformer-based model that has consistently achieved state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks. In this paper, the model has been trained in 4 ways: 16 batch size with 5 epochs, 16 batch size with 10 epochs, 32 batch size with 5 epochs, and 32 batch size with 10 epochs. Among these approaches, the model performed well when training in 16 batch sizes with 10 epochs obtaining an overall accuracy of 84% in the wine datasets. The study showcases the effectiveness of thisapproach in the wine industry and the recommendation systems.<br/><img src='/images/wine_project/wine_confusion_matrix.png'>"
