title: "Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews and Tweets"
excerpt: "This project delves into sentiment analysis through the lens of diverse data sources, focusing on Amazon product reviews and Twitter posts. In the realm of Amazon product reviews, extensive exploratory data analysis was conducted, complemented by the visualization of sentiment through word clouds. Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, naive Bayes, and LightGBM, were employed to predict sentiments in unseen data.

Shifting gears to sentiment analysis on Twitter, data was systematically gathered using web scraping techniques. Leveraging the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from NLTK, the project extracted sentiments from tweets on specific topics. Visualization techniques, such as word frequency analysis, were employed to distill insights from positive and negative tweets. Further analysis included the identification of frequently used hashtags and feature extraction using both bag of words and TF-IDF methodologies.

A classifier was trained utilizing naive approaches, and the subsequent exploration revealed the nuanced impact of features derived from 'keywords' and 'key-phrases.' The model exhibited improved positive predictions when employing 'keywords,' while 'key-phrase'-based features enhanced negative predictions. This nuanced approach to sentiment analysis sheds light on the importance of feature selection and its impact on model performance across distinct data sources.<br/><img src='/images/sentiment_analysis_project/wordclouds_for_positive_reviews.png'>"
